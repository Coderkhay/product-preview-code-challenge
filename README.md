# product-preview-code

A frontend mentor challenge that displays an object to be bought on a website to the buyer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
  -Taiwindcss
- Flexbox
  -Vscode

### What I learned

I learned a powerful css framework(tailwindcss) which combines both html and css codes on a single page with annoying navigation from file to file,it implements utility first class.As powerful as it seems, the only issue is it makes code pretty much cumbersome . Aside from it's bulky nature which tailwind imposes on the code it's no different from VANILLA CSS

### Continued development

My tailwindcss is still somewhat deficient mainly because this is my first ever project built using this framework also I am finding it hard to grasp some concepts like "redefining the default values of some properties within the tailwind config file and the use of arbitrary values". The responsiveness of my projects are also to put under consideration, these are the aspects where my focus would be for now.
